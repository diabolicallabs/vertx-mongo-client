= Vert.x MongoDB Client

A Vert.x client allowing applications to interact with a MongoDB instance, whether that's
saving, retrieving, searching, or deleting documents.

Mongo is a great match for persisting data in a Vert.x application
as it natively handles JSON (BSON) documents.

*Features*

* Completely non-blocking
* Custom codec to support fast serialization to/from Vert.x JSON
* Supports a majority of the configuration options from the MongoDB Java Driver

This client is based on the
http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.2/driver-async/getting-started[MongoDB Async Driver].

== Using Vert.x MongoDB Client

To use this project, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-mongo-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-mongo-client:3.4.2-SNAPSHOT'
----


== Creating a client

You can create a client in several ways:

=== Using the default shared pool

In most cases you will want to share a pool between different client instances.

E.g. you scale your application by deploying multiple instances of your verticle and you want each verticle instance
to share the same pool so you don't end up with multiple pools

The simplest way to do this is as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-mongo/mongo_client'

client = VertxMongo::MongoClient.create_shared(vertx, config)


----

The first call to `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#create_shared-class_method[MongoClient.createShared]`
will actually create the pool, and the specified config will be used.

Subsequent calls will return a new client instance that uses the same pool, so the configuration won't be used.

=== Specifying a pool source name

You can create a client specifying a pool source name as follows

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-mongo/mongo_client'

client = VertxMongo::MongoClient.create_shared(vertx, config, "MyPoolName")


----

If different clients are created using the same Vert.x instance and specifying the same pool name, they will
share the same pool.

The first call to `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#create_shared-class_method[MongoClient.createShared]`
will actually create the pool, and the specified config will be used.

Subsequent calls will return a new client instance that uses the same pool, so the configuration won't be used.

Use this way of creating if you wish different groups of clients to have different pools, e.g. they're
interacting with different databases.

=== Creating a client with a non shared data pool

In most cases you will want to share a pool between different client instances.
However, it's possible you want to create a client instance that doesn't share its pool with any other client.

In that case you can use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#create_non_shared-class_method[MongoClient.createNonShared]`.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-mongo/mongo_client'

client = VertxMongo::MongoClient.create_non_shared(vertx, config)


----

This is equivalent to calling `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#create_shared-class_method[MongoClient.createShared]`
with a unique pool name each time.


== Using the API

The client API is represented by `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html[MongoClient]`.

=== Saving documents

To save a document you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#save-instance_method[save]`.

If the document has no `\_id` field, it is inserted, otherwise, it is _upserted_. Upserted means it is inserted
if it doesn't already exist, otherwise it is updated.

If the document is inserted and has no id, then the id field generated will be returned to the result handler.

Here's an example of saving a document and getting the id back

[source,ruby]
----

# Document has no id

document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

mongoClient.save("books", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    id = res
    puts "Saved book with id #{id}"

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----

And here's an example of saving a document which already has an id.

[source,ruby]
----

# Document has an id already

document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit",
  '_id' => "123244"
}

mongoClient.save("books", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    # ...

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----

=== Inserting documents

To insert a document you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#insert-instance_method[insert]`.

If the document is inserted and has no id, then the id field generated will be returned to the result handler.

[source,ruby]
----

# Document has an id already

document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

mongoClient.insert("books", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    id = res
    puts "Inserted book with id #{id}"

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----

If a document is inserted with an id, and a document with that id already eists, the insert will fail:

[source,ruby]
----

# Document has an id already

document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit",
  '_id' => "123244"
}

mongoClient.insert("books", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    #...

  else

    # Will fail if the book with that id already exists.
  end

}


----

=== Updating documents

To update a documents you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#update-instance_method[update]`.

This updates one or multiple documents in a collection. The json object that is passed in the `update`
parameter must contain http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update-field/[Update Operators] and determines
how the object is updated.

The json object specified in the query parameter determines which documents in the collection will be updated.

Here's an example of updating a document in the books collection:

[source,ruby]
----

# Match any documents with title=The Hobbit
query = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

# Set the author field
update = {
  '$set' => {
    'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
  }
}

mongoClient.update("books", query, update) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    puts "Book updated !"

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----

To specify if the update should upsert or update multiple documents, use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#update_with_options-instance_method[updateWithOptions]`
and pass in an instance of `link:../dataobjects.html#UpdateOptions[UpdateOptions]`.

This has the following fields:

`multi`:: set to true to update multiple documents
`upsert`:: set to true to insert the document if the query doesn't match
`writeConcern`:: the write concern for this operation

[source,ruby]
----

# Match any documents with title=The Hobbit
query = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

# Set the author field
update = {
  '$set' => {
    'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
  }
}

options = {
  'multi' => true
}

mongoClient.update_with_options("books", query, update, options) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    puts "Book updated !"

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----

=== Replacing documents

To replace documents you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#replace-instance_method[replace]`.

This is similar to the update operation, however it does not take any update operators like `update`.
Instead it replaces the entire document with the one provided.

Here's an example of replacing a document in the books collection

[source,ruby]
----

query = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

replace = {
  'title' => "The Lord of the Rings",
  'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
}

mongoClient.replace("books", query, replace) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    puts "Book replaced !"

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end

}


----

=== Finding documents

To find documents you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#find-instance_method[find]`.

The `query` parameter is used to match the documents in the collection.

Here's a simple example with an empty query that will match all books:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'json'

# empty query = match any
query = {
}

mongoClient.find("books", query) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    res.each do |json|

      puts JSON.generate(json)

    end

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end

}


----

Here's another example that will match all books by Tolkien:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'json'

# will match all Tolkien books
query = {
  'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
}

mongoClient.find("books", query) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    res.each do |json|

      puts JSON.generate(json)

    end

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end

}


----

The matching documents are returned as a list of json objects in the result handler.

To specify things like what fields to return, how many results to return, etc use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#find_with_options-instance_method[findWithOptions]`
and pass in the an instance of `link:../dataobjects.html#FindOptions[FindOptions]`.

This has the following fields:

`fields`:: The fields to return in the results. Defaults to `null`, meaning all fields will be returned
`sort`:: The fields to sort by. Defaults to `null`.
`limit`:: The limit of the number of results to return. Default to `-1`, meaning all results will be returned.
`skip`:: The number of documents to skip before returning the results. Defaults to `0`.

----
require 'json'

# will match all Tolkien books
query = {
  'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
}

mongoClient.find_batch("book", query) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    if (res == nil)

      puts "End of research"

    else

      puts "Found doc: #{JSON.generate(res)}"

    end

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end
}


----

The matching documents are returned unitary in the result handler.

=== Finding a single document

To find a single document you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#find_one-instance_method[findOne]`.

This works just like `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#find-instance_method[find]` but it returns just the first matching document.

=== Removing documents

To remove documents use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#remove_documents-instance_method[removeDocuments]`.

The `query` parameter is used to match the documents in the collection to determine which ones to remove.

Here's an example of removing all Tolkien books:

[source,ruby]
----

query = {
  'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
}

mongoClient.remove("books", query) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    puts "Never much liked Tolkien stuff!"

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end
}


----

=== Removing a single document

To remove a single document you use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#remove_document-instance_method[removeDocument]`.

This works just like `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#remove_documents-instance_method[removeDocuments]` but it removes just the first matching document.

=== Counting documents

To count documents use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#count-instance_method[count]`.

Here's an example that counts the number of Tolkien books. The number is passed to the result handler.

[source,ruby]
----

query = {
  'author' => "J. R. R. Tolkien"
}

mongoClient.count("books", query) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    num = res

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end
}


----

=== Managing MongoDB collections

All MongoDB documents are stored in collections.

To get a list of all collections you can use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#get_collections-instance_method[getCollections]`

[source,ruby]
----

mongoClient.get_collections() { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    collections = res

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end
}


----

To create a new collection you can use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#create_collection-instance_method[createCollection]`

[source,ruby]
----

mongoClient.create_collection("mynewcollectionr") { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    # Created ok!

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end
}


----

To drop a collection you can use `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#drop_collection-instance_method[dropCollection]`

NOTE: Dropping a collection will delete all documents within it!

[source,ruby]
----

mongoClient.drop_collection("mynewcollectionr") { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    # Dropped ok!

  else

    res_err.print_stack_trace()

  end
}


----


=== Running other MongoDB commands

You can run arbitrary MongoDB commands with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#run_command-instance_method[runCommand]`.

Commands can be used to run more advanced mongoDB features, such as using MapReduce.
For more information see the mongo docs for supported http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command[Commands].

Here's an example of running an aggregate command. Note that the command name must be specified as a parameter
and also be contained in the JSON that represents the command. This is because JSON is not ordered but BSON is
ordered and MongoDB expects the first BSON entry to be the name of the command. In order for us to know which
of the entries in the JSON is the command name it must be specified as a parameter.

[source,ruby]
----

command = {
  'aggregate' => "collection_name",
  'pipeline' => [
  ]
}

mongoClient.run_command("aggregate", command) { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    resArr = res['result']
    # etc
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}


----

=== MongoDB Extended JSON support

For now, only date, oid and binary types are supported (cf http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json )

Here's an example of inserting a document with a date field

[source,ruby]
----

document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit",
  'publicationDate' => {
    '$date' => "1937-09-21T00:00:00+00:00"
  }
}

mongoService.save("publishedBooks", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    id = res

    mongoService.find_one("publishedBooks", {
      '_id' => id
    }, nil) { |res2_err,res2|
      if (res2_err == nil)

        puts "To retrieve ISO-8601 date : #{res2['publicationDate']['$date']}"

      else
        res2_err.print_stack_trace()
      end
    }

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----

Here's an example (in Java) of inserting a document with a binary field and reading it back

[source,ruby]
----
byte[] binaryObject = new byte[40];

JsonObject document = new JsonObject()
        .put("name", "Alan Turing")
        .put("binaryStuff", new JsonObject().put("$binary", binaryObject));

mongoService.save("smartPeople", document, res -> {

  if (res.succeeded()) {

    String id = res.result();

    mongoService.findOne("smartPeople", new JsonObject().put("_id", id), null, res2 -> {
      if(res2.succeeded()) {

        byte[] reconstitutedBinaryObject = res2.result().getJsonObject("binaryStuff").getBinary("$binary");
        //This could now be de-serialized into an object in real life
      } else {
        res2.cause().printStackTrace();
      }
    });

  } else {
    res.cause().printStackTrace();
  }

});
----

Here's an example of inserting a base 64 encoded string, typing it as binary a binary field, and reading it back

[source,ruby]
----

#This could be a the byte contents of a pdf file, etc converted to base 64
base64EncodedString = "a2FpbHVhIGlzIHRoZSAjMSBiZWFjaCBpbiB0aGUgd29ybGQ="

document = {
  'name' => "Alan Turing",
  'binaryStuff' => {
    '$binary' => base64EncodedString
  }
}

mongoService.save("smartPeople", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    id = res

    mongoService.find_one("smartPeople", {
      '_id' => id
    }, nil) { |res2_err,res2|
      if (res2_err == nil)

        reconstitutedBase64EncodedString = res2['binaryStuff']['$binary']
        #This could now converted back to bytes from the base 64 string
      else
        res2_err.print_stack_trace()
      end
    }

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----
Here's an example of inserting an object ID and reading it back

[source,ruby]
----

individualId = Java::OrgBsonTypes::ObjectId.new().to_hex_string()

document = {
  'name' => "Stephen Hawking",
  'individualId' => {
    '$oid' => individualId
  }
}

mongoService.save("smartPeople", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    id = res

    mongoService.find_one("smartPeople", {
      '_id' => id
    }, nil) { |res2_err,res2|
      if (res2_err == nil)
        reconstitutedIndividualId = res2['individualId']['$oid']
      else
        res2_err.print_stack_trace()
      end
    }

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}


----
Here's an example of getting distinct value

[source,ruby]
----
document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

mongoClient.save("books", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    mongoClient.distinct("books", "title", Java::JavaLang::String::class.get_name()) { |res2_err,res2|
      puts "Title is : #{res2[0]}"
    }

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}

----
Here's an example of getting distinct value in batch mode

[source,ruby]
----
document = {
  'title' => "The Hobbit"
}

mongoClient.save("books", document) { |res_err,res|

  if (res_err == nil)

    mongoClient.distinct_batch("books", "title", Java::JavaLang::String::class.get_name()) { |res2_err,res2|
      puts "Title is : #{res2['title']}"
    }

  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

}

----

== Storing/Retrieving files and binary data

The client can store and retrieve files and binary data using MongoDB GridFS. The
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html[MongoGridFsClient]` can be used to send a whole files or buffers
to GridFS. If the object being stored is large, it can be stored one buffer at a time so as
to avoid Out of Memory exceptions.

=== Get the MongoGridFsClient to interact with GridFS.

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html[MongoGridFsClient]` is created by calling
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoClient.html#create_grid_fs_bucket_service-instance_method[createGridFsBucketService]` and providing a bucket name. In GridFS, the bucket name
ends up being a collection that contains references to all of the objects that are stored. By default the
bucket name is "fs". You can segregate objects into distinct buckets by providing a unique name.

This has the following fields:

`bucketName`:: The name of the bucket to create

Here's an example of getting a `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html[MongoGridFsClient]` with the default bucket
name

[source,ruby]
----
mongoClient.create_grid_fs_bucket_service("fs") { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    client = res
    #Interact with the GridFS client...
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}


----

=== Drop an entire file bucket in GridFS.

An entire file bucket along with all of its contents can be dropped with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#drop-instance_method[drop]`. It will
drop the bucket that was mentioned when the MongoGridFsClient was created.

Here is an example of deleting a file bucket.

[source,ruby]
----
gridFsClient.drop() { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    #The file bucket is dropped and all files in it, erased
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Find all file IDs in a GridFS bucket.

A list of all of the file IDs in a bucket can be found with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#find_all_ids-instance_method[findAllIds]`.
The files can be downloaded by ID using `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_file_by_id-instance_method[downloadFileByID]` or
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_buffer_by_id-instance_method[downloadBufferById]`.

Here is an example of retrieving the list of file IDs.

[source,ruby]
----
gridFsClient.find_all_ids() { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    ids = res
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Find file IDs in a GridFS bucket using a query.

A list of file IDs in a bucket that match a query can be found with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#find_ids-instance_method[findIds]`.

This has the following fields:

`query`:: The is a json object that can match any of the file's metadata using standard MongoDB query operators. An empty
json object will match all documents

The files can be downloaded by ID using `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_file_by_id-instance_method[downloadFileByID]` or
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_buffer_by_id-instance_method[downloadBufferById]`.

Here is an example of retrieving the list of file IDs based on a metadata query.

[source,ruby]
----
query = {
  'metadata.nick_name' => "Puhi the eel"
}
gridFsClient.find_ids(query) { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    ids = res
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Delete a file in GridFS based on its ID.

A file previously stored in GridFS can be deleted with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#delete-instance_method[delete]` by providing
the ID of the file. The file IDs can be retrieved with a query using `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#find_ids-instance_method[findIds]`.

Parameters:
`id`:: The ID generated by GridFS when the file was stored

Here is an example of deleting a file by ID.

[source,ruby]
----
id = "56660b074cedfd000570839c"
gridFsClient.delete(id) { |res|
  if (res.succeeded?())
    #File deleted
  else
    #Something went wrong
    res.cause().print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Upload a file in GridFS

A file can be stored by name with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#upload_file-instance_method[uploadFile]`. When it
succeeds, the ID generated by GridFS will be returned. That ID can be used to retrieve the file later.

This has the following parameters:

`fileName`:: this is name used to save the file in GridFS

[source,ruby]
----
gridFsClient.upload_file("file.name") { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    id = res
    #The ID of the stored object in Grid FS
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Upload a file in GridFS with options.

A file can be stored with additional options with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#upload_file_with_options-instance_method[uploadFileWithOptions]`
passing in an instance of `link:../dataobjects.html#UploadOptions[UploadOptions]`.

This has the following parameters:

`metadata`:: this is a json object that includes any metadata that may be useful in a later search
`chunkSizeBytes`:: GridFS will break up the file into chunks of this size

Here is an example of a file upload that specifies the chunk size and metadata.

* [source,ruby]
----
metadata = {
}
metadata['nick_name'] = "Puhi the Eel"

options = {
}
options['chunkSizeBytes'] = 1024
options['metadata'] = metadata

gridFsClient.upload_file_with_options("file.name", options) { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    id = res
    #The ID of the stored object in Grid FS
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Download a file previously stored in GridFS

A file can be downloaded by its original name with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_file-instance_method[downloadFile]`

This has the following parameters:

`fileName`:: the name of the file that was previously stored

Here is an example of downloading a file using the name that it was stored with in GridFS.

* [source,ruby]
----
gridFsClient.download_file("file.name") { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    fileLength = res
    #The length of the file stored in fileName
  else
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

=== Download a file previously stored in GridFS given its ID

A file can be downloaded to a given file name by its ID with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_file_by_id-instance_method[downloadFileByID]`.

This has the following fields:

`id`:: The ID generated by GridFS when the file was stored

Here is an example of downloading a file using the ID that it was given when stored in GridFS.

=== Download a file from GridFS to a new name

A file can be resolved using its original name and then downloaded to a new name
with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_file_as-instance_method[downloadFileAs]`. When successful it will return an
ID generated by GridFS.

This has the following parameters:

`fileName`:: the name of the file that was previously stored
`newFileName` :: the new name for which the file will be stored

=== Using buffers to transfer files

Transferring the contents of entire files over the event bus could cause out of memory errors. To avoid this
you can use buffers to transfer the contents one chunk at a time.

GridFS provides a way to upload and download files over streams. We encapsulate those streams in
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html[MongoGridFsUpload]` and `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsDownload.html[MongoGridFsDownload]`. When uploading or downloading
files using buffers, you will be provided an instance of one of these. You will then manage the stream with your own
handler.

`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html[MongoGridFsUpload]`.

If there is a buffer available to upload, call
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html#upload_buffer-instance_method[uploadBuffer]`. An integer will be returned indicating
how many bytes were saved.

If there are no more data to upload call `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html#end-instance_method[end]`. The result will be an
ID generated by GridFS.

Here is an example of an upload handler:

`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsDownload.html[MongoGridFsDownload]`.

When there are data to download, read will be called.
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsDownload.html#read-instance_method[read]`. It will provide a buffer of data as a `link:../dataobjects.html#GridFsBuffer[GridFsBuffer]`

=== Upload a buffer to GridFS and save with a file name

A buffer can be uploaded to GridFS with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#upload_buffer-instance_method[uploadBuffer]`. When successful it will return a
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html[MongoGridFsUpload]`.

This has the following parameters:

`fileName`:: the name that the file will be saved as in GridFS

If there is a buffer available to upload, call
`link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html#upload_buffer-instance_method[uploadBuffer]`. An integer will be returned indicating
how many bytes were saved.

If there is no more data to upload call `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsUpload.html#end-instance_method[end]`. The result will be an
ID generated by GridFS.

=== Upload a buffer to GridFS with options and save with a file name

A buffer can be uploaded to GridFS with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#upload_buffer_with_options-instance_method[uploadBufferWithOptions]`
passing in an instance of `link:../dataobjects.html#UploadOptions[UploadOptions]`.

This has the following fields:

`metadata`:: this is a JsonObject that includes any metadata that may be useful in a later search
`chunkSizeBytes`:: GridFS will break up the file into chunks of this size

Here is an example of using a handler to upload a file using buffers with Options.

=== Download a file's contents one buffer at a time given its name.

A file previously stored in GridFS can be downloaded to a series of buffers
with `link:../../yardoc/VertxMongo/MongoGridFsClient.html#download_buffer-instance_method[downloadBuffer]` by providing
this GridFS ID of the file.

This has the following parameters:

`fileName`:: the name that the file will be saved as in GridFS

Here is an example of downloading a file to buffers by ID.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx/future'
bufferSize = 1024
id = "56660b074cedfd000570839c"
stream = Java::JavaIo::FileOutputStream.new("eel.fil")
gridFsClient.download_buffer_by_id(id) { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    download = res
    downloadCompleteFuture = Vertx::Future.future()
    downloadCompleteFuture.set_handler() { |downloadRes_err,downloadRes|
      if (downloadRes_err == nil)
        #Download finished
      else
        #Something went wrong
        raise downloadRes_err
      end
    }
    handle_download_example(stream, download, bufferSize, &downloadCompleteFuture.completer())
  else
    #Something went wrong
    res_err.print_stack_trace()
  end

== Configuring the client

The client is configured with a json object.

The following configuration is supported by the mongo client:


`db_name`:: Name of the database in the mongoDB instance to use. Defaults to `default_db`
`useObjectId`:: Toggle this option to support persisting and retrieving ObjectId's as strings. If `true`, hex-strings will
be saved as native Mongodb ObjectId types in the document collection. This will allow the sorting of documents based on creation
time. You can also derive the creation time from the hex-string using ObjectId::getDate(). Set to `false` for other types of your choosing.
If set to false, or left to default, hex strings will be generated as the document _id if the _id is omitted from the document.
Defaults to `false`.

The mongo client tries to support most options that are allowed by the driver. There are two ways to configure mongo
for use by the driver, either by a connection string or by separate configuration options.

NOTE: If the connection string is used the mongo client will ignore any driver configuration options.

`connection_string`:: The connection string the driver uses to create the client. E.g. `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
For more information on the format of the connection string please consult the driver documentation.
